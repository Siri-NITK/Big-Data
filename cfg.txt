terminal
non terminal

Terminal symbols never occur to the left of a rewrite arrow. 
Non-terminal symbols may occur either to the right or the left of the rewrite arrow .


Why are such grammars called `context free'? Because all rules contain only one symbol on the left hand side --- and wherever we see that symbol while doing a derivation, we are free to replace it with the stuff on the right hand side. That is, the `context' in which a symbol on the left hand side of a rule occurs is unimportant --- we can always use the rule to make the rewrite while doing a derivation.

Every derivation corresponds to a parse tree, and every parse tree corresponds to (maybe many) derivations.

We think of CFG rules as telling us which tree structures we have.
